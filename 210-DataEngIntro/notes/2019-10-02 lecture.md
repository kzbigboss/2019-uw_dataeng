      - Articles along with tips on how to read through them quickly.
      - Lots of original research papers that influenced the systems that we'll study.
    - Final project
      - Nice to work in a group but not a requirement.
    - Breaks
      - One break every hour or so
  - Introducing big data and data engineering
    - Big data: data too big to process on a single machine
    - The traditional V's
      - Volume
      - Velocity
      - Variety
    - New V's
      - Variability
      - Veracity
      - Value
  - Data Science v Data Engineering
    - Science: acquire knowledge
    - Engineering: apply knowledge
  - Big Data Systems, history
    - Analytics isn't new
    - Data warehouse isn't new
  - New architectures
    - Enabled by virtualization and distributed systems.
    - Cloud providers lowered the barrier by enabling users to rent equipment instead of purchase.
  - Rise of Hadoop
    - Core components inspired by Google research papers
    - Started as an open source (Apache) project, other commercial providers emerged
  - Impact of Hadoop
    - HDFS + MapReduce + higher lever abstractions
      - Widely available, open source
    - Hadoop models (storage/compute) influenced other major systems (eg Spark)
  - Hadoop discontents
    - MapReduce, not new, sometimes referred to as a backwards step
      - Explained in the week one readings
    - Writing MapReduce jobs, requires large shift in thinking and programming style, ugly/verbose/messy
    - Can be slow
      - Lives on disk storage
      - IO and lifecycle impacted, expensive IO
      - Starts by reading HDFS and writes to HDFS
  - Computing Fundamentals, brief review
    - Mechanical sympathy: understanding the system helps you run the system even if you didn't build the system
  - Other notes
